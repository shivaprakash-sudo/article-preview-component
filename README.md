## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind-css - For styles

### What I learned

Positioning and displaying the social icons container was harder than I thought it would be, but I eventually figured it out, by rearranging the content in html file.

### Continued development

I'd like to work more on positioning containers with respective their different parent containers.
